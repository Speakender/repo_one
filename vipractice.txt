this is a test for playing around in vi.
pressing i moves you from command mode to insert mode so you can type. pressing a will also work.
arrows keys will navigate up down left right

also
j -left
l -right
j -down
k -up


escape key breaks out of insert mode and goes to command mode.
from command mode
x deletes a charater
5x deletes 5 chacters

d deletes a word
5d would delete 5 words
dd deletes a line

:w writes
:q quits vi editor
:wq would write and quit
:q! quit without saving
